# Basically Zero. 

## Just Kidding

I have had some trouble in college trying to find what I want to do in life. I went to Missouri S&T with a friend hoping to become a mechanical engineer with the help of and internship I had with General Electric Transportation before leaving for college.  Unfortantely S&T did not work out and I got a scholarship offer of Room and Board to play on the Rocket league team here at Mizzou, kinda rad. Last fall is when I started taking Information Technology classes and I think this is where I am going to stay. 

- GPA of 3.535 at Mizzou
- Total GPA: 2.7
- National Champion in Rocket League (NACE)
  - Got a ring with my name on it and trophy
- Top 8 last fall in CRL
- Top 4 in spring
