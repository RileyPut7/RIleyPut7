Competitive baseball for as long as I can remember throughout high-school! Ton of practice to maintain my spot on top tier showcase team for
Prodigy, JCCC Cavaliers showcase team, and Cubs.

I've been having a insane time as a player for the Mizzou Esports Program and would like to thank a lot of people for this opportunity. We've been flown out to Atlanta to compete for a national championship title as well as playing on stage in front of my mom and sister and about a hundred people. It was the most fun I've had as a gamer.
